Business Process Optimization Framework
=======================================

The Business Process Optimization framework can be used to simulate an operational business process in combination
with a particular technique for forecasting and a particular technique for planning. The results of different
variants (of the process, forecasting technique or planning technique) can be compared and visualized.

Typical business processes that could be compared include:

* processing mortgage applications at a bank, where several tasks must be executed for each application. The arrival of new applications can be forecasted and the assignment of bank employees to (tasks of) applications must be planned.
* planning supply for production, where the tasks include purchasing and producing materials. The demand can be forecasted. The optimal time at which materials must be purchased and produced can be planned.
* processing incoming containers at a seaport for onward transportation. The arrival of new containers can be forecasted as well as their processing times in the port and possible delays in onward transportation. The assignment of containers to onward transportation must be planned.

The business process to simulate can be specified, but also mined from a business process event log.

More information on how to use the framework can be found in the documentation_.
