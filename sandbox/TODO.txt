X Add split dataset
  # log = pandas.read_csv("../bpo/resources/BPI Challenge 2017 - clean.zip")
  # mine_problem(log, earliest_start=datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1), latest_completion=datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 28))

X Add data distributions

Add task processing time distributions depending on: case data/ resource/ task/ tasks that have happened

Include error term in previous step.

Add random planner.

Add simulation not pre-loaded with cases

Add assignment when n tasks/resources are available (not each time one becomes available)

Create simulator. Check simulated log against real log.

Use both resource cost and cycle time as objective. Groups are compared on both of them equally.

Create competition code. Obfuscate code.
