X Add split dataset
  # log = pandas.read_csv("../bpo/resources/BPI Challenge 2017 - clean.zip")
  # mine_problem(log, earliest_start=datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1), latest_completion=datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 28))

X Add data distributions

X Add task processing time distributions depending on: case data/ resource/ task/ tasks that have happened

X Include error term in previous step.

Create simulator for the result.

Add random planner.

Add simulation not pre-loaded with cases

Test the simulator.

Add assignment when n tasks/resources are available (not each time one becomes available)

Use both resource cost and cycle time as objective. Groups are compared on both of them equally.

Create competition code. Obfuscate code.
